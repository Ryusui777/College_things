# 1: test works by creating a file with vole instructions and prestablished
     intructions (if wanted)

# 2: for the file, it has to be a txt file, like 'demofile.txt', and has to
     be inputed between '' like 'demofile.txt' and each instruccion has to
     be on a separate lines, there can't be any line blank and each one has
     to be an instuction and to enter memory locations you have to put the
     word "memory" in one line and the lines below that one will be read as
     instructions.

# 2.1: the way to enter memory is by putting the memory location in hexadecimal
       then a - and the value to be assigned to that memory space like "a0-12"
       the value '12' will be stored in the memory position 'a0'.

# 3: Every characther after the intruction or memory will not be compilled so
     that space can be use to add comments about your code like:
     '0x12fe this loads to the register......'

#    Keep In Mind   #
1. Every characther has to be lower case
2. At the end of the program the register that were used and the memory that was
   used will be printed
3. As a recommendation the instruction_file should be in the same directory(folder)
   that you're in
### that's all (I think)###
To take a look on how it works you can run it with the demofile.txt
